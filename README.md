# DH2642 Project
This project implements a lobby service for gamers.

In a lobby users can add games they want to play and times when they're available and how many users each of their games requires. When enough users have the same game, those users are alerted that they have enough players.


#Installation and execution
    npm install
    node app.js

## TODO
* Support for different rooms
* Serverside checks for timeline & games abuse
* Notify users when a game has enough players
* Allow users to set min (and max?) amount of players for a game
* Polish interaction
